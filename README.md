# Learning Rust - A Lesson in Humility

J. M. Barrie - Author of Peter Pan
> Life is a long lesson in humility... and so is learning Rust.

I tried to teach myself `C++` a while back, but wasn't enjoying it. I still have the internal desire to learn a low-level programming language, and so I am going to take a second stab at it with `Rust`. To help myself with the process and make it more engaging I will document the journey here in this repository. Each session will be encapsulated in it's directoy with source code included. When I get off topic or overly verbose I will extract some of the text and place it in the [Extracts.md](https://github.com/GaryMcD/Learning-Rust-A-Lesson-in-Humility/blob/main/Extracts.md).

If you are reading along and find errors or typos, feel free to submit a pull request to resolve it. I will work on implementing fixes and edits as quickly as I can.

Thanks for joining me on this adventure!
